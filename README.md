# Instructions for Download and Use

These are two python files that summarize my ongoing use of Bayesian Optimization
(BO) work during my PhD. I primarily use these methods to solve difficult problems
in cell culture media optimization. I would heavily recommend looking into the 
[botorch](https://www.https:botorch.org/) python package, and for more information
about customized kernels and Gaussian Process Models look into the [gpytorch](https://gpytorch.ai/)
package.

It is recommended to use a '''conda''' environment (via Anaconda) to download 
and manage the following python packages for 'DBO_Solver.py'.

'''
python 3.3.8 (>= 3.7 recommended)
botorch 0.3.3 (0.6.1.dev48+g812f08a3 for MOBO_Solver.py)
gpytorch 1.3.0
pytorch 1.7.1 (>= 1.9 recommended)
scipy 1.6.1
